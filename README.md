# Library Management System (LMS)

A Java backend project following a 7-month structured learning roadmap from core Java to production-ready Spring Boot deployment.

---

## 📋 About

A library management system demonstrating professional software development practices:
- Book and magazine inventory management
- User and librarian role-based operations
- Loan tracking with automated due dates and fine calculations

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Package Structure
```
com.library/
├── model/       # Domain entities (Book, User, Librarian, etc.)
├── util/        # Utilities (DateUtil for date calculations)
├── service/     # Business logic (Week 3+)
└── LibraryApplication.java
```

### Design Principles
- **OOP Fundamentals:** Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction
- **Clean Architecture:** Separation of concerns across packages
- **Interface-Based Design:** Loanable interface for flexible implementations

---

## ✨ Current Features

**Month 1, Week 2 - Complete** ✅

- Core entity management (Book, Magazine, User, Librarian)
- Inheritance hierarchy and polymorphism
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Loan operations (checkout/return)
- Date utilities (due dates, overdue days, fine calculation)
- Organized package structure

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

**Current:**
- Java 17+
- Git
- IntelliJ IDEA

**Upcoming:**
- Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Spring Security, Docker, Redis, CI/CD

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SeifeddineTalks/Library-Management-System.git
cd Library-Management-System

# Open in IntelliJ IDEA and run LibraryApplication.java
```

**Expected Output:** Book/magazine details, user info, date calculations
