# Library Management System (Java Application)

This is a foundational Java application designed to simulate the core functions of a library. It is structured to demonstrate a clean, maintainable approach to solving a real-world business problem.

## 🏗️ Technical & Architectural Focus

The core objective of this project is to showcase clean code and professional structure:

1.  **Object-Oriented Design (OOD):** Clean separation of responsibilities into core entity classes (`Book`, `Member`) and service classes (`LibraryService`).
2.  **Standard Structure:** Utilizes the standard `src/main/java/com.library` package structure for enterprise readiness.
3.  **Data Structures:** Employs Java Collections (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`) for managing in-memory data persistence.

## 🛣️ 6-Month Project Roadmap (Scalability Plan)

This project is the basis for a 6-month learning roadmap and is designed to evolve:

| Month/Phase | Focus Area | Technology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Month 1 (Current)** | **Core Logic & OOP** | Pure Java, Classes, Collections |
| **Month 2** | **Data Persistence** | Relational Database (e.g., MySQL), JDBC, basic SQL |
| **Month 3** | **Web Development** | Conversion to Spring Boot Web Application (REST API) |
| **Months 4-6** | **Advanced Features** | Spring Security, Unit Testing (JUnit), Advanced Design Patterns |

## 💻 Setup and Usage

* **Language:** Java
* **Build Tool:** IntelliJ-based project structure
* **Version Control:** Git
